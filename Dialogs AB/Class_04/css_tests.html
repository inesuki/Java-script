<h3>Communication/ representation skills</h3>
<p>For almost 13 years I have been working for this company. One of my main tasks has been communication and cooperation with my colleagues (also foreign) and other units. When mentoring new and existing employees and sharing knowledge to the colleagues, I have also maintained good communication/information representation skills. In my work I have solved many problem situations where fast solutions are needed (for example during closing period).  I am customer oriented and service minded.</p>
